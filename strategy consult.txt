Real Estate Strategy Consult

Major life transitions often involve real estate decisions that carry financial, legal, and timing implications.

The Real Estate Strategy Consult is a paid, professional session designed to provide clarity around market context, pricing posture, and next-step options before decisions are made.

This consultation is neutral, documented, and focused on understanding — not pressure.

- Equity considerations

PROFESSIONAL CONTEXT (IMPORTANT)

- Customers receive clarity without pressure
- Brokerage compliance is maintained

If any instruction conflicts with brokerage policy,
Claude must defer to broker guidance and request clarification.
