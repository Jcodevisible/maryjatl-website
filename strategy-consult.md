## Introduction

Major life transitions often involve real estate decisions that carry financial, legal, and timing implications.

The Real Estate Strategy Consult is a paid, professional session designed to provide clarity around market context, pricing posture, and next-step options before decisions are made.

This consultation is neutral, documented, and focused on understanding — not pressure.

---

## What the Strategy Consult Is

The Strategy Consult is a structured conversation focused on real estate considerations during divorce, separation, or other major life transitions.

**It is intended to help you understand:**
- Market conditions and timing considerations
- Equity considerations (high-level, not a valuation)
- Sale-path options
- Documentation that may be required
- Practical next steps

This consult is informational in nature and does not require a commitment to list.
